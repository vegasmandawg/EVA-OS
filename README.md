## 🔮 About EVA OS · Core Positioning

EVA OS is an **open-source, multimodal, low-latency** real-time AI Agent engine designed for next-generation AI hardware. It is deeply optimized for mobile devices, IoT hardware, and embedded systems. It fills the gap between “device intelligence” and “user experience.”

Through the EVA platform, developers can quickly create Solutions (AI Agents) with real-time multimodal interaction, and with a single API Key achieving **“develop once, run on all devices.”** Any hardware can instantly become a “real-time multimodal interactive, agent-cooperative, memory-capable AI hub.”

> Core Benefits: EVA-flash model permanently free | Mobile SDK 100% open source | ESP32/RK/MCU embedded SDK coming soon

## **🧠 The Vision Behind EVA OS**

Our belief:

* Foundation models are merely “neurons”
* AI hardware needs a “nervous system”
* **EVA OS aims to become the nervous system of next-generation AI devices**

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2a7f170-b0e9-44d5-ad6d-cd830fcfe328)
### **AIOS (AI Operating System)** is defined as “the nervous system of next-generation AI hardware”

* **​Interaction Layer：​** From **single-modality** to **multi-modality**  
  The system can simultaneously understand text, speech, images, video, etc. It also supports barge-in, speech interruption, and real-time responsiveness, making AI “converse like a human.”

* **​Memory Layer：** ​From **text** memory to **multimodal** memory
  And from **storage-based** memory to **parameterized** memory.  
  The AI remembers not only text, but also images, audio, and contextual modalities —- making memory deeper and more integrated.

* **Execution Layer：** From **simple API calls to complex reasoning**
  EVA OS evolves from executing fixed commands to performing logical reasoning and solving complex tasks.

* **Persona Layer (Representation)：** From **programmed behavior to model-driven dynamics**  
  The AI’s “persona” becomes dynamic, adaptive, and humanlike—shaped by large model reasoning rather than rigid code.
